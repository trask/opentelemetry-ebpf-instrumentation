# OpenTelemetry eBPF Instrumentation

This repository provides eBPF instrumentation based on the OpenTelemetry standard.
It provides a lightweight and efficient way to collect telemetry data using eBPF for user-space applications.

:construction: This project is currently work in progress.

## How to start developing

Requirements:
* Docker
* GNU Make

1. First, generate all the eBPF Go bindings via `make docker-generate`. You need to re-run this make task
   each time you add or modify a C file under the [`bpf/`](./bpf) folder.
2. To run linter, unit tests: `make fmt verify`.
3. To run integration tests, run either:
```
make integration-test
make integration-test-k8s
make oats-test
```
, or all the above tasks. Each integration test target can take up to 50 minutes to complete, but you can
use standard `go` command-line tooling to individually run each integration test suite under
the [test/integration](./test/integration) and [test/integration/k8s](./test/integration/k8s) folder.
